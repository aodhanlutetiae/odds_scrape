This repository uses Actions to run a scraper at a given time. It's currently set to scrape the letters page of the Irish Times at 2am UK time every day and to append the headings of the letters to a csv file (letter_headings.csv). It's based on [a walkthrough from NICAR 2022](https://palewi.re/docs/first-github-scraper/index.html) by [Ben Welsh](https://github.com/palewire/). It can run the scraper as either a .py file or as a jupyter notebook.
